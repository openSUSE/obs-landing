    description: "Adrian started his open source career as a developer of the first ripping tool for the KDE desktop (Krabber).
    In '99 SUSE hired him to be their Linux Desktop guy, so he spent the next couple of years taking care of the KDE desktop of the different SUSE Linux distributions.
    During that time he gathered a lot of knowledge about building software packages for consumer and enterprise customers.
    Which eventually lead him to his current position as project manager for the SUSE and openSUSE build infrastructure.

    \nWhen he's not out sailing or hiking and taking [pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/adrianschroeter) of it,
    you will most likely catch him thinking about the future of OBS."

    At SUSE Michael shares the role of project manager for the SUSE and openSUSE build infrastructure with Adrian.
