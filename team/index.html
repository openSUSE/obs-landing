    description: "Adrian started his open source career as a developer of the first ripping tool for the KDE desktop (Krabber).
    In '99 SUSE hired him to be their Linux Desktop guy, so he spent the next couple of years taking care of the KDE desktop of the different SUSE Linux distributions.
    During that time he gathered a lot of knowledge about building software packages for consumer and enterprise customers.
    Which eventually lead him to his current position as project manager for the SUSE and openSUSE build infrastructure.

    \nWhen he's not out sailing or hiking and taking [pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/adrianschroeter) of it,
    you will most likely catch him thinking about the future of OBS."

    A **full stack developer** of the modern web who develops in Ruby on Rails.

    \nHenne is beefing up the OBS Frontend, documentation and the projects promotion when he's not out viciously supporting his hometown football club or teaching free software development with programs such as [RailsGirls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org)."

    description: "After years of being the source maintainer of the KDE desktop environment (over 6 million line of code and more than 1800 contributors) and being the release manager of two different GNU/Linux distributions (Caldera and openSUSE) Stephan Kulow (Coolo) knows what makes maintainers of huge projects tick and uses that knowledge to make the OBS better suited for this job.

    \nIf you know Coolo it won't surprise you that he won't be reduced to using OBS and takes action with hacking the web client, API and other components to make his work easier."

    description: "Michael, is another FOSS old-timer in the team. Most hackers probably know him as one of the GNU screen maintainers, perl guru and dependency solver expert.
    Even before the inauguration of the Open Build Service Michael worked on the SUSE internal OBS predecessor _autobuild_, which means he brings more than 10 years of experience in developing build system backends to the table!
    At SUSE Michael shares the role of project manager for the SUSE and openSUSE build infrastructure with Adrian.

    \nApart from expanding the OBS backend with all kinds of cool features and taking care of the reference server backend, cooking good food and gaming make Michael a happy man."

    Initially a system administrator he started to develop web-based software in Perl in 2002.
    He recently joined the team and is currently going through a tough OBS backend bootcamp with his drill instructor Michael.

    \nBesides standing around one of his kettle grills and celebrating BBQ's, he's an expert in prototyping rc-cars based open-source computer hardware like the raspPi or arduino."

    When he's not busy with lectures, writing papers and enjoying the sweet student life he is taking care of the OBS command line client and library.
    His participation in the Free and Open Source community sparked as packager for the PackMan project, a 3rd party application repository for SUSE/openSUSE distributions.

    \nAs the only guy not well in his thirties and with full hair he proudly represents the next generation of Open Build Service hackers."
