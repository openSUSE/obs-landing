_We started off the [continuous integration between OBS and GitHub/GitLab](/2021/05/31/scm-integration/) in May 2021,
then [made some improvements](/2021/06/14/scm-integration-improvements/) in June 2021.
We introduced advanced features like [reporting filters and support for self-hosted SCM](/2021/07/12/scm-integration-more-improvements)
together with a list of [common pitfalls](/2021/07/12/scm-integration-pitfalls) in July 2021
and in August 2021, we continued with [two new steps and a UI for tokens](/2021/08/02/link-package-configure-repositories-and-ui).
In September 2021, we [supported more actions for pull/merge requests, improved the UI for tokens](/2021/09/14/scm-more-pull-request-actions-and-ui),
and [added support for push events and a rebuild step](/2021/09/28/support-for-push-events). At the beginning of November 2021, we presented the [user documentation and further improvements for the UI for tokens](/2021/11/09/scm-integration-documentation).
In November 2021, we introduced [workflow runs and more](/2021/11/22/scm-workflow-runs). Now, we have made [UI and reporting improvements](/2022/01/24/scm-integration-report-improvements)._

_This feature is documented in the [SCM/CI Workflow Integration chapter](https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/cha.obs.scm_ci_workflow_integration.html) of the [OBS User Guide](https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/)._
