Our efforts to foster collaboration started in August 2024,
when we [introduced labels and bug report links](/2024/08/14/introduction-labels-and-foster-collab).
Next, we [improved labels to foster collaboration](/2024/09/25/improving-labels), allowed  [labeling projects](/2025/01/21/project-labels) and introduced the functionality of [managing labels with the API](/2025/05/05/labels-api). Building on
that, we [introduced Assignments](/2025/05/15/foster-collaboration).
Recently, weâ€™ve introduced package version tracking based on the [Release Monitoring](/2025/09/23/foster-collaboration) which has been enhanced with the [Package Version Information](/2025/10/23/foster-collaboration)
