On XX, January XXth, the Content Moderation feature will be moved out of the beta program
to make it accessible for all the OBS users.
Unfortunately, OBS is not free from spam, scam, malicious packages or other forms of users misconduct.
The Content Moderation tools help users and moderators to keep them under control.

OBS users can easily report any problematic content. After some in-site conversation, the moderators can take a decision,
remove the malicious item and even remove the user account.
