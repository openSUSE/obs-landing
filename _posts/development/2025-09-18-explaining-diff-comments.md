By now, many OBS users have noticed that the Changes tab has its own place, and for good reason.

The new layout separates code diffs, build results, and conversations into focused tabs.
In the old interface, if you wanted to discuss proposed changes in the diff, you had to
switch back and forth between the diff and the comment section. With the new Changes tab,
discussions about specific changes can stay right where they belong, next to the code itself,
and diff comments are also visible in the Conversation tab.

This is how you can add a new comment.

As you can see, diff comments are also available in the Conversation tab, allowing
you to continue the discussion there as well.

This makes it easier to follow feedback, keep reviews organized, and ensure nothing gets lost
in a long conversation thread. If you havenâ€™t started using it yet, give it a try in your review process,
leave a comment on a specific line, and see how much smoother code reviews can be.
