---

On XX, November XXth, after a few months in the beta program, the Labels feature will become a
core feature for every OBS user.
The labels provide a visual method to organize your work. You can customize your labels with unique names and colors
and apply them to projects, packages and requests to categorize them based on their importance, topic, status or any other marker you can think of.

We are eating our own dog food already. Go and start applying the labels on your items as well!
