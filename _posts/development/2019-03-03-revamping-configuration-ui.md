We are one step closer to revamping the whole OBS user interface!

Here is a comparison of the old and new user interface of the main configuration page:

# Architectures

You can now see all architectures at a glance and enable/disable them all at once.
Everything is done through AJAX, thus removing the need for an 'Update' button and saving you a click.

# Manage Users

We have simplified the 'Actions' column of the datatable to only show the three most important actions: 'Edit User', 'Send Email to User' and 'Delete User'.
You can still lock/confirm a user and make him/her an Admin, it's all on the 'Edit User' page.

# Manage Groups

These pages were migrated without major changes, except for the group members tab on the group overview page.
We put the focus on the group members and their avatar, displaying them side by side to efficiently use the available space.

# Interconnect

We replaced the unorthodox form and form-filler button combo by a list of default interconnects and a modal to add custom interconnects.

# And Much More

We addressed some issues we identified and gathered from your feedback.
Hereâ€™s a subset of what has been fixed and improved.

We use modals on a few pages and the text of their submit button used to always be 'Accept'.
It could confuse users depending on the context of the modal, so we aligned the submit button's text to their action.

On the project overview page, the modal for linking projects is now correctly working.

Timestamps for all pages of the source files table on the package overview page are now relative.
It used to be the case only on the first page of the table.
