title:  Introducing Release Monitoring in OBS
category: development
---
Over the last few days, weâ€™ve been focused on bringing release monitoring to OBS to help you keep track of the local and upstream releases.

These updates are part of the `Foster Collaboration` beta program. You can find more information about the beta program [here](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program/).

### OBS:AnityaDistribution Attribute

To keep track of upstream releases, OBS uses a project attribute called **`OBS:AnityaDistribution`**.
The value of this attribute can be the name of any distribution listed on [release-monitoring.org](https://release-monitoring.org/distros/).

Once the attribute is set, OBS will take care of the rest. After you assign the value, OBS will automatically search for your packages on [release-monitoring.org](https://release-monitoring.org/distros/) and keep track of the latest version. This makes it much easier in OBS to stay up to date with the latest upstream releases of your packages.

### Finding the Local and Upstream Version

OBS also allows you to compare your **local package version** (defined in the `spec` file) with the **upstream version**.
Both versions are shown side by side: on the **project page** in the package list, and on the **individual package page**.
