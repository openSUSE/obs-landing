As you may know, some months ago we started migrating our old UI technology to [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). :tada:
The main reason to do that is that the old technology is chaotic and doesn't have an standard way to write UI code with established components and defined style.
This makes understanding the code, fixing bugs and adding new features UI related a painful and lengthy task.
The old UI is also not responsive (it doesn't properly work in phones and tablets), which is something we want to change now.

We are progressively implementing pages in the new UI and there is already some work done.
It already looks great! :heart_eyes:
Just an advance:

<img src="/images/posts/beta/1.png" alt="Main page in new UI" style="width: 45%;">
<img src="/images/posts/beta/2.png" alt="Package view in new UI" style="width: 45%;">

Until the new UI is finished, you will keep seeing the old one by default.
But as the migration will be a long process, we have a beta version.
Everybody can join the beta program to try the new OBS for the parts already implemented and to soon discover other new pages as well.
We want to hear feedback from all of you as soon as possible! :kissing_closed_eyes:


# How to join the beta program?

Joining the beta program is really easy!
You can enable it in your profile page at <https://build.opensuse.org/home> by clicking in the _Join public beta program_ link (you need to be logged in):

<img src="/images/posts/sprint-report-45/3.png" alt="Page for the link 'Join public beta program'">

And of course you can leave the beta at any time by clicking the _Leave public beta program_ link, which will be shown in place of the enable link in your profile, once you have the beta enabled.


# How to provide feedback?

Is there a workflow from the old version which is not in the new one?
Is there something broken?
Or something that looks ugly?
Let us now!
You just need to open an issue in Github at [https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues/new](https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues/new?template=Bug_report.md).
Write a description of what the problem is and steps to reproduce it.
The more details you add, the better: screenshots, the url of the page, etc.
Do not forget to mention that the issue is related with the new UI.

Before opening an issue is a good idea to check [the issues list](https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Frontend+%F0%9F%91%BB%22) to avoid reporting a problem, which someone else has already reported.
In case you have more information about an already open issue, it will be helpful that you add a comment to the issue with it. :wink:

Take into account that at the moment we are just migrating to the new technology, making the page responsive, but without making significant design and workflow changes.
It would be really confusing for users if from one day to another we change the whole interface.
Because of that, design changes will be progressively introduced and only after the migration is completed and the new UI enabled for all user.
You can of course provide feedback and ideas regarding the design, but remember that it will take some time until we are able to make those changes.

Join the beta program now and help us improving OBS.
We are looking forward to hearing from you! :cupid:
