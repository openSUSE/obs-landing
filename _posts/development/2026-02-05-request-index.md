title: More Sorting Options, Counters and Help With the Search for Your Requests
category: development
---

We further improved the request index page to help you keep track of all the requests you are involved in.
This time, we've added more options to sort your requests, counters to the individual filters and  documentation for the search functionality.

### Sort Requests by Comment Amount and Age

Do you want to know which of your requests have the most user activity?
One possible indicator can be the number of comments a request received.
This is why we introduced sorting of requests by the amount comments received.
By default, requests are sorted descending by its creation time, which can now be adjusted (oldest to newest and vice versa).

### Counters

Before you start fine-tuning your selection with individual filter options, it is helpful to know which requests fall under certain filter categories and how many, if any.
That's why we added counters next to the corresponding filter options to give you an overview upfront.

### Help with the Search Box

A while ago, we introduced the free text search option for the request index page.
To help you get the most out of this search feature, we’ve added a quick-reference guide next to the search box.
It clarifies which fields are searchable (such as comment content) and outlines the supported query syntax.
Just click the little question mark icon to see it in action.
