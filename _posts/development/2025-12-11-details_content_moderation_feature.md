The Content Moderation feature is now available to every user in OBS to combat spam, abuse, and misconduct effectively.
It provides a powerful toolset for both users and moderators to report, review, and act on problematic content across OBS.

## Reporting

Any user in OBS can report any misconduct across a wide range of OBS objects: comments, users, projects, packages, and requests.

A report can be categorized using predefined categories (like _Spam_ or _Forbidden license_) to improve clarity and consistency.

Reporters can easily flag the creator of a comment simultaneously when reporting the comment, ensuring malicious user accounts are reviewed immediately.

## Moderation

Moderators duty is to act upon malicious content or problematic users based on the evidence or other users' reports.

Their actions can be as straightforward as hiding problematic comments, but sometimes moderation requires more effort.
A dedicated Report Comments section allows moderators and reporters to discuss a report directly within OBS,
leading to more informed outcomes before taking a decision in favor or against the report.

To ensure accountability and fairness, moderators have access to detailed information, including a complete list of user-specific comments
and the full history of edited comments.

Customizable _Canned Responses_ allow moderators to quickly and consistently communicate decisions to the involved parties.

Furthermore, they can simultaneously make a decision and take the necessary action (e.g., delete a project or a user account).

## Notifications

This entire system is built on transparency. Users are notified of all moderation decisions via web and email and have the ability to appeal actions
taken against their content, ensuring a balanced and accountable moderation process.
