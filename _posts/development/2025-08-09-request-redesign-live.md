After working on the redesign of the request workflow for a long time, the feature is about to go live.

As [recently announced](2025-08-08-rollout-is-coming.md), the rollout of the new feature will be gradual. Starting XX/XX/XXXX, some of you will begin to see the new user interface.

We appreciate your patience as we all get used to the new workflow.
Stay tuned for a new blog post with a complete breakdown of the new UI.
