title: Open Build Service version 2.4 released
category: releases
---
<p>
After one whole year of hard work, toil, tears and sweat from all our awesome contributors the latest
release of the <a href="http://www.open-build-service.org" title="OBS Home Page">Open Build Service(OBS)</a>
is ready for you. Version 2.4 adds support for yet another package format, secure boot signing and appstream
app stores. It also brings a constraint system to better match build hardware to build jobs and includes a lot
of speed improvements. OBS 2.4 is the latest, greatest and rock solid release that is already used by our
reference server since January. We strongly recommended to update to this version.

<h6>PKGBUILD, Secure Boot and AppStream Support</h6>
<p>
With OBS 2.4 it is now possible to build packages in the PKGBUILD format used for instance by the popular
Arch Linux distribution. This is the third package format, after RPM and DEB, supported by the OBS which makes
it feasible to build and ship software for all the major Linux distributions that use a binary package format.
Another popular demand for build servers these days is the support for signing individual files (bootloader, driver etc.)
inside packages with a cryptographic key to support standards like UEFI secure boot. In version 2.4 the
OBS sign daemon has been extend to handle this security feature. And with the rise of App-Stores as means to
distribute software to end users this OBS release brings support for the cross-distribution application metadata
standard AppStream.
</p>


<h6>New Build Constraints System</h6>
<p>
Constraints can be defined for packages and projects inside the OBS to only build on worker instances that fulfill
these constraints. The types of constraints vary from software constraints like requiring a minimum kernel version,
over hardware constraints like requiring a specific CPU flag or size of disk/memory to OBS constraints like the type
of sandbox the worker uses to execute the build.
<br />
Each successfull build in OBS 2.4 now produces statistics over the used disk space, memory and I/O usage which can
be used as a base for setting constraints.
<br />
With this constraint system it is not only possible to better match build jobs to build environments but it also can
be used to run, for instance, package benchmarks always on the same worker or distinguish between secure and insecure
build environments. Documentation about this can be found in the
<a href="http://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-reference-guide/cha.obs.build_job_constraints.html">
Open Build Service Reference Guide.</a>
</p>


<h6>Massive Speed Improvements</h6>
<p>
Packager/Developer time is a very valueable so we are constantly working on improving the speed of the OBS.
For 2.4 we have added support for preinstall images of dependencies to speed up the assembly of the worker sandboxes.
These images include all the files so unpacking them is way faster than unpacking single packages. We also added better
caching of build metadata, grouping of repository metadata writes and more efficient merging of scheduler metadata. 
And we have made the interconnect of different OBS instances asynchronus. This will avoid scheduler hangups with slow
or broken network to a remote instance.
