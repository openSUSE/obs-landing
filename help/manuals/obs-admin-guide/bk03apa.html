 <p>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
  document, but changing it is not allowed.

 <div class="sect2 " id="idm139887180069200"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title legal" id="idm139887180069200"><span class="name">Preamble</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="bk03apa.html#idm139887180069200">#</a></h3></div></div></div>
  
  <p>
   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
   share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended
   to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure
   the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies
   to most of the Free Software Foundation’s software and to any other
   program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
   Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License
   instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
  </p>
  <p>
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
   General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
   to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
   wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
   can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
   you know you can do these things.
  </p>
  <p>
   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
   deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
   restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
   copies of the software, or if you modify it.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
   for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You
   must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you
   must show them these terms so they know their rights.
  </p>
  <p>
   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
   offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
   and/or modify the software.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also, for each author’s protection and ours, we want to make certain
   that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.
   If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
   recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any
   problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
   authors’ reputations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
   wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
   individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
   proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
   licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all.
  </p>
  <p>
   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
   follow.
  </p>
 </div>




 <div class="sect2 " id="idm139887180061888"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title legal" id="idm139887180061888"><span class="name">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="bk03apa.html#idm139887180061888">#</a></h3></div></div></div>
  
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">0. </span>
   
    This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
    placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
    of this General Public License. The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Program</span>”</span>, below, refers
    to any such program or work, and a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">work based on the Program</span>”</span>
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that
    is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">modification</span>”</span>.) Each licensee is addressed as
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">you</span>”</span>.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
   by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
   is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
   contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
   made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
   Program does.
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">1. </span>
   
    You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source
    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
    disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
    License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients
    of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
   may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">2. </span>
   
    You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
    thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
    modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
    also meet all of these conditions:
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">a). </span>
   
    You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    you changed the files and the date of any change.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">b). </span>
   
    You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
    part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
    this License.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">c). </span>
   
    If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you
    must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
    ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
    copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying
    that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program
    under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
    normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not
    required to print an announcement.)
   
  </p>
  <p>
   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
   sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
   reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
   this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
   distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections
   as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
   the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
   licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
   regardless of who wrote it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
   rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
   the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
   based on the Program.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
   the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage
   or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
   License.
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">3. </span>
   
    You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
    Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
    and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">a). </span>
   
    Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
    which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
    medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">b). </span>
   
    Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
    any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">c). </span>
   
    Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
    noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object
    code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b
    above.)
   
  </p>
  <p>
   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
   the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
   definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
   installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
   code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
   either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
   and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
   component itself accompanies the executable.
  </p>
  <p>
   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
   copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
   source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
   even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
   the object code.
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">4. </span>
   
    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
    expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
    modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
    have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">5. </span>
   
    You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
    However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
    Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
    do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
    Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
    this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
    distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">6. </span>
   
    Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
    the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor
    to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
    conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
    recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">7. </span>
   
    If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so
    as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
    other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
    the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
    royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
    directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy
    both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of
    the Program.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
   the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
   or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
   this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
   software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
   practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
   software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
   application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he
   or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a
   licensee cannot impose that choice.
  </p>
  <p>
   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
   consequence of the rest of this License.
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">8. </span>
   
    If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
    countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
    copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
    explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
    that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
    excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
    written in the body of this License.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">9. </span>
   
    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
    the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
    similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">any later version</span>”</span>, you have the option of following the terms
   and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
   the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
   number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
   Free Software Foundation.
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">10. </span>
   
    If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
    whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
    permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
    Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
    exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
    preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
    promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   <p>
    <span class="formalpara-title">11. </span>
    
     BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
     THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
     OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
     PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
     EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
     WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
     ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="formalpara-title">12. </span>
    
     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
     ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
     REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
     INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
     ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
     LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
     SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE
     WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN

  <p>
   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
   use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
   which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
  </p>
  <p>
   To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
   attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
   exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">copyright</span>”</span> line and a pointer to where the full notice is
   found.
  </p>
<div class="verbatim-wrap"><pre class="screen">   one line to give the program’s name and an idea of what it does.

  <p>
   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when
   it starts in an interactive mode:

   The hypothetical commands `show w’ and `show c’ should show the

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your

  <p>
   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
   functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom:
   to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
   or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
   Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to
   get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
   modifications made by others.
  </p>
  <p>
   This License is a kind of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">copyleft</span>”</span>, which means that
   derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
   It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
   designed for free software.
  </p>
  <p>
   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
   software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
   should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does.
   But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any
   textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
   printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose
   is instruction or reference.

  <p>
   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
   contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
   distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
   world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
   under the conditions stated herein. The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Document</span>”</span>, below,
   refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee,
   and is addressed as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">you</span>”</span>. You accept the license if you copy,
   modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright
   law.
  </p>
  <p>
   A <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Modified Version</span>”</span> of the Document means any work containing
   the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language.
  </p>
  <p>
   A <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Secondary Section</span>”</span> is a named appendix or a front-matter
   section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
   publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
   subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
   directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a
   textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
   mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection
   with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
   philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
  </p>
  <p>
   The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Invariant Sections</span>”</span> are certain Secondary Sections whose
   titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
   that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section
   does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be
   designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.
   If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are
   none.
  </p>
  <p>
   The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Cover Texts</span>”</span> are certain short passages of text that are
   listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
   that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be
   at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
  </p>
  <p>
   A <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Transparent</span>”</span> copy of the Document means a machine-readable
   copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
   general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly
   with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint
   programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
   suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
   variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an
   otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
   been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is
   not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any
   substantial amount of text. A copy that is not <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Transparent</span>”</span> is
   called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Opaque</span>”</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
   without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using
   a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or
   PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats
   include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
   can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for
   which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
   the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
   processors for output purposes only.
  </p>
  <p>
   The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Title Page</span>”</span> means, for a printed book, the title page
   itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
   material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
   formats which do not have any title page as such, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Title Page</span>”</span>
   means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title,
   preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
  </p>
  <p>
   A section <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Entitled XYZ</span>”</span> means a named subunit of the Document
   whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
   text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a
   specific section name mentioned below, such as
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Acknowledgements</span>”</span>, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Dedications</span>”</span>,
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Endorsements</span>”</span>, or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span>.) To <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Preserve
   the Title</span>”</span> of such a section when you modify the Document means that
   it remains a section <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Entitled XYZ</span>”</span> according to this
   definition.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
   states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers
   are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as
   regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty
   Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this
   License.
  </p>
 </div>

 <div class="sect2 " id="idm139887179995104"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title legal" id="idm139887179995104"><span class="name">VERBATIM COPYING</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="bk03apa.html#idm139887179995104">#</a></h3></div></div></div>
  
  <p>
   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
   or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and
   the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are
   reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to
   those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
   control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
   However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you
   distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
   conditions in section 3.
  </p>
  <p>
   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
   may publicly display copies.
  </p>
 </div>

 <div class="sect2 " id="idm139887179975040"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title legal" id="idm139887179975040"><span class="name">COPYING IN QUANTITY</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="bk03apa.html#idm139887179975040">#</a></h3></div></div></div>
  
  <p>
   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed
   covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s
   license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers
   that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on
   the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must
   also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The
   front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
   prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
   Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the
   title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as
   verbatim copying in other respects.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
   you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
   actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
   than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
   with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
   computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
   access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
   Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
   latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
   distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
   copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
   year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through
   your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
   Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them
   a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
  </p>
 </div>

  <p>
   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
   conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
   Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
   role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
   Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
   these things in the Modified Version:
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">A. </span>
   
    Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
    that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
    there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may
    use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that
    version gives permission.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">B. </span>
   
    List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
    together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all
    of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release
    you from this requirement.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">C. </span>
   
    State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,
    as the publisher.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">D. </span>
   
    Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">E. </span>
   
    Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the
    other copyright notices.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">F. </span>
   
    Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
    the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
    License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">G. </span>
   
    Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
    required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">H. </span>
   
    Include an unaltered copy of this License.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">I. </span>
   
    Preserve the section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span>, Preserve its Title,
    and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
    publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is
    no section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span> in the Document, create one
    stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on
    its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated
    in the previous sentence.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">J. </span>
   
    Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
    access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
    locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
    These may be placed in the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span> section. You may omit a
    network location for a work that was published at least four years before
    the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
    to gives permission.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">K. </span>
   
    For any section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Acknowledgements</span>”</span> or
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Dedications</span>”</span>, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve
    in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
    acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">L. </span>
   
    Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
    text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
    considered part of the section titles.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">M. </span>
   
    Delete any section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Endorsements</span>”</span>. Such a section may
    not be included in the Modified Version.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">N. </span>
   
    Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Endorsements</span>”</span> or to conflict in title with any Invariant
    Section.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="formalpara-title">O. </span>
   
    Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
   
  </p>
  <p>
   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
   that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
   Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
   invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
   the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct
   from any other section titles.
  </p>
  <p>
   You may add a section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Endorsements</span>”</span>, provided it
   contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
   parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been
   approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
  </p>
  <p>
   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
   passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
   Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
   and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by)
   any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same
   cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you
   are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the
   old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the
   old one.
  </p>
  <p>
   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
   permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
   endorsement of any Modified Version.

  <p>
   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
   provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections
   of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
   Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve
   all their Warranty Disclaimers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
   identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there
   are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,
   make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
   parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if
   known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
   titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
   combined work.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span> in the various original documents, forming one
   section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span>; likewise combine any sections
   Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Acknowledgements</span>”</span>, and any sections Entitled
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Dedications</span>”</span>. You must delete all sections Entitled

  <p>
   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
   released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
   License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the
   collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
   copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
  </p>
  <p>
   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
   individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
   into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
   regarding verbatim copying of that document.

  <p>
   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
   independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
   resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the
   compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the
   Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the
   other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of
   the Document.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
   the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
   aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
   bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of
   covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on
   printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

  <p>
   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
   translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
   Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their
   copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant
   Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
   You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices
   in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
   include the original English version of this License and the original
   versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between
   the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
   disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

   If a section in the Document is Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Acknowledgements</span>”</span>,
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Dedications</span>”</span>, or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span>, the requirement
   (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
   Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns. See
   http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

  <p>
   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
   Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">or any later version</span>”</span> applies to it, you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of
   any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free
   Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of
   this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by
   the Free Software Foundation.

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
   License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices
   just after the title page:
  </p>
<div class="verbatim-wrap"><pre class="screen">   Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.
   Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
   under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
   or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
   with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
   A copy of the license is included in the section entitled “GNU
   Free Documentation License”.</pre></div>
  <p>
   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
   replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:
  </p>
<div class="verbatim-wrap"><pre class="screen">   with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
   Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.</pre></div>
  <p>
   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
   combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
   situation.
  </p>
  <p>
   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
   releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software
   license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free
   software.
