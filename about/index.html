  <h2>What can the Open Build Service do?</h2>
    <p align="justify">
    The Open Build Service (OBS) is a generic system to build and distribute binary packages from sources in an automatic,
    consistent and reproducible way. You can release packages as well as updates, add-ons, appliances and entire
    distributions for a wide range of operating systems and hardware architectures.

    <h3>For Users</h3>
    <p align="justify">
    Your users can always download the latest version of your software as binary packages for their operating system.
    They use the package management tools they are familiar with and will get your software just like they get software
    from their OS supplier. They don't have to know about tarballs, make install, package formats or other stuff from
    the 90's. Once they are connected to your repository, you can serve them with maintenance or security updates and
    even add-ons for your software. The OBS makes it a breeze for you, to make it super easy for them to enjoy your software!

    <h3>For Packagers</h3>
    <p align="justify">
    The OBS builds your packages in a jailed environment that the OBS setups from scratch each time and once your build
    succeeds it also rebuilds all the depend packages for you. That way you get an automatic, consistent and reproducible
    build of your software so you always know what you deliver to your users. There is also no need anymore for you to
    maintain a lot of different OS installations on a lot of different hardware architectures or to deal with "compiler
    farms". Let the OBS help you to concentrate on packaging, that's what you are here to do right?

    <h3>For Free Software Projects and Independent Software Vendors</h3>
    <p align="justify">
    The OBS, through it's project model, has collaboration build in and will help you to harness the power of the open
    source development model. Your developers get a one-stop-shop experience for all their software packaging and releasing
    needs. The OBS API allows different clients and external services to interface and to use its resources. Of course OBS
    is free software, licensed under GPL, and can be installed on your hardware, in your data center so you keep all your
    data under your control.

    <h2>Who is using it?</h2>
    <p align="justify">
    Our reference implementation for openSUSE, at <a href="http://build.opensuse.org">build.opensuse.org</a>, currently
    has almost 30.000 users that are building over 140.000 packages for 21 base distributions on 6 architectures. Besides
    the openSUSE project, a large number of other Free and Open Source projects like <a href="https://www.tizen.org/">Tizen</a>,
    <a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VideoLAN</a>, companies like <a href="http://www.dell.com">Dell</a>,
    <a href="http://www.cray.com/">Cray</a> or <a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</a>, but also universities are running
    their own instances of the OBS.
